description: "The Last of the Barons is a historical novel by the English author Edward\
  \ Bulwer-Lytton first published in 1843. Its plot revolves around the power struggle\
  \ between the English King Edward IV and his powerful minister Earl of Warwick,\
  \ known as \"Warwick the kingmaker\".\nThe King is portrayed as effeminate, capricious\
  \ and licentious, in contrast with the Earl, shown as a distinguished warrior and\
  \ politician, great patriot and affectionate father. Other historical figures that\
  \ appear frequently in the text are Duke of Clarence, Duke of Gloucester (the future\
  \ King Richard III), Marquess of Montagu, and Lord Hastings.\nRomance and science\
  \ in the Middle Ages are the secondary themes of the novel. They are explored through\
  \ Sibyll, a beautiful young maiden, and her old father, Adam Warner. Sibyll, who\
  \ is in love with Lord Hastings, is inseparable from her father throughout the story.\
  \ Adam is a hypomanic natural philosopher working for many years to complete his\
  \ invention, a mechanical device that is supposed to carry out functions of a modern\
  \ steam engine. Persecuted, mistrusted, and misunderstood, he is forced to work\
  \ as a royal alchemist.\nThe novel ends tragically with the defeat and death of\
  \ Warwick at the Battle of Barnet.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
